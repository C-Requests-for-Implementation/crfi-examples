# Title
Common metaprogramming macros

## Status
EXAMPLE

## Abstract
Basic metaprogramming operations are repetitive and frequently needed for
extension library programming. This CRFI defines some simple commonly-used
macro operations (looping etc.) so that they do not need to be repeated by
the implementation of every single subsequent CRFI that performs any kind
of static looping or control structure extensions.

## Issues

## Rationale

Looping, new control structures, argument counting, etc. are commonly used
operations when defining library interfaces that mimic language structures.
This centralizes the provision of such operators.

## Specification

// TODO

## Implementation

See attached file.
