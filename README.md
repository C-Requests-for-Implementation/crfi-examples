# crfi-examples
Simple examples of CRFIs

This repository demonstrates how example CRFI submissions might look.

Apart from CRFI-0, none of these examples are guaranteed to be given
numbers in the real list. These examples will not be maintained once
there are enough exmaples in the real list.

The list of ideas in CRFI-ideas is a starting point, and welcome to 
be picked up for real submissions, but does not indicate that any 
features named there will be part of the real feature list.

Do not submit bug reports against the examples' technical content,
as that is not the point.
